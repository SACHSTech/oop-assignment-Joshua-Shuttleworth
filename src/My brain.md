# My brain on oop
AHHAHAAHAHAH I don't know what I am doing anymore. My grocery store makes no sense I am so close to just saying bugger all of this and just starting over!!!!
*DEEP BREATHS* Calm...

## Part 2
Ok Uh starting over might work but it's a bit late and I kinda wanna sleep.

## Part 3 - of the epic trilogy!
I don't even know if I will commit this but whatever, I am thinking starting over is the best bet because I keep sinking so much time into this janky mess of spaghetti code.

##### I sware the code on the left is what my code is like...

## Part 4 - wait there is more?
I was thinking about changing topics as well... Man that seems like a even worse idea now that I say it (type it) but I am just tired and just frustrated enough that I might do it.

## Part 5 - I'm doing this
Ok I am doing this lets see the topics again!
* A shopping cart checkout system for an online retailer
* A Netflix user's "My List" of movies and shows and the recommendations that derive from it
* A Spotify user's saved songs, albums and podcasts.
* The organization of student membership to clubs and teams within a school
* The hierarchy of staff at a company
* The organization of shoes in a closet and the process of deciding what shoes to wear
* An instagram post and the resulting likes and comments 
* Uber ride service
* A menu and checkout system for a food delivery service i.e UberEats, DoorDash

Hmmm I might go back to the spotify users saved songs but I am just thinking about how I will add songs and stuff. "The hierarchy of staff at a company" seems like it would not be too hard it's so similar to the example ones we did in class.

## Part 6 - why is there no part 1?
That's a good question uhhh... Anyway I am going to talk to the teacher in class tomarrow I will probably show him this markdown thing.
##### Did you know tomorrow is misspelled in the text above

## Part 7 <- I like the number 7 quq
This started out as a joke document but I think it perfectly outlines my thought process. So I will most likely commit it.
